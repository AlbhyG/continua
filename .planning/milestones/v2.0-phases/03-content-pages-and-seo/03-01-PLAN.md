<objective>

Purpose: Deliver the core informational content visitors need to understand what Continua is, who it serves, and what it does.
Output: Three fully-rendered content pages at `/`, `/who`, and `/what` with unique metadata and proper typography.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update home page with introductory content, typography, and metadata</name>
  <files>src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the placeholder content in src/app/page.tsx with the full home page implementation:

1. Add metadata export at top of file:
   - `import type { Metadata } from 'next'`
   - `export const metadata: Metadata = { title: 'Continua - Personality Assessment Platform', description: 'Transform conflicts into complementarity. Understand personality as fluid coordinates across six dimensions.' }`

2. Replace the component body with semantic HTML and verbatim content from docs/web-architecture.md Section 3 "Home Page Text":
   - Wrap in `<main className="max-w-[375px] md:max-w-[720px] mx-auto px-6 pt-20 pb-12">`
   - h1 with exact text: "How can we improve the human condition one person, one couple, one family, and one office at a time?"
   - h1 classes: `text-[48px] md:text-[64px] leading-[1.2] font-bold mb-6` (style guide: 48px mobile, 64px at md breakpoint)
   - Body text wrapper: `<div className="text-[18px] md:text-[20px] leading-[1.6] space-y-5">`
   - Three `<p>` tags with the three paragraphs from Section 3, verbatim:
     - Paragraph 1: "This is not a goal with an end state but, rather, the beginning of a process..."
     - Paragraph 2: "The purpose of this exploration is not to define personality..."
     - Paragraph 3: "We introduce that vision: a way of seeing personality as fluid coordinates..."
   - Copy text EXACTLY from web-architecture.md. Do NOT paraphrase or edit.

3. Keep the component as a Server Component (no 'use client' directive). Page is purely static content.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` in the project root. Build should succeed with no errors. The `/` route should appear in build output with static indicator.</verify>
  <done>Home page exports unique metadata, renders h1 at 48px/64px with verbatim heading text, renders three body paragraphs at 18px/20px with verbatim content from architecture doc Section 3, uses semantic HTML (main, h1, div, p).</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Who and What pages with content, metadata, and cross-links</name>
  <files>src/app/who/page.tsx, src/app/what/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create two new page routes. All content comes VERBATIM from docs/web-architecture.md.

**Who page (src/app/who/page.tsx):**

1. Add metadata export:
   - `import type { Metadata } from 'next'`
   - `import Link from 'next/link'`
   - `export const metadata: Metadata = { title: 'Who is Continua For? | Continua', description: 'Continua helps individuals, couples, families, and teams understand personality patterns across different contexts.' }`

2. Semantic HTML structure with content from Section 2.2 "Who Page Text":
   - `<main className="max-w-[375px] md:max-w-[720px] mx-auto px-6 pt-20 pb-12">`
   - `<h1 className="text-[32px] font-bold mb-8">Who is Continua For?</h1>`
   - `<section className="space-y-8">` wrapping four audience divs
   - Each audience: `<div>` containing `<h2 className="text-[24px] font-bold mb-3">` and `<p className="text-[18px] md:text-[20px] leading-[1.6]">`
   - Four audiences: "For Individuals", "For Couples", "For Families", "For Teams"
   - Copy all paragraph text VERBATIM from web-architecture.md Section 2.2

3. Cross-link to What page after the section, using exact text from architecture doc:
   - `<p className="text-[18px] md:text-[20px] leading-[1.6] mt-8 italic">`
   - Text: "Want to see how it works? Check out " + `<Link href="/what" className="underline hover:text-accent transition-colors">What</Link>` + " to learn about taking assessments, viewing results, and exploring your personality coordinates over time."

**What page (src/app/what/page.tsx):**

1. Add metadata export:
   - `import type { Metadata } from 'next'`
   - `import Link from 'next/link'`
   - `export const metadata: Metadata = { title: 'What Does Continua Do? | Continua', description: 'Take personality assessments, see your results across contexts, and get personalized tools and actions for growth.' }`

2. Semantic HTML structure with content from Section 2.3 "What Page Text":
   - `<main className="max-w-[375px] md:max-w-[720px] mx-auto px-6 pt-20 pb-12">`
   - `<h1 className="text-[32px] font-bold mb-8">What Does Continua Do?</h1>`
   - `<section className="space-y-8">` wrapping three feature divs
   - Three features: "Take Assessments", "See Your Results", "Tools and Actions"
   - Each with `<h2 className="text-[24px] font-bold mb-3">` and body paragraphs at `text-[18px] md:text-[20px] leading-[1.6]`
   - IMPORTANT: "See Your Results" has THREE paragraphs in the architecture doc. Use three `<p>` tags. The second and third paragraphs use `mt-4` for spacing within the same div.
   - Copy all paragraph text VERBATIM from web-architecture.md Section 2.3

3. Cross-link to Who page after the section, using exact text from architecture doc:
   - `<p className="text-[18px] md:text-[20px] leading-[1.6] mt-8 italic">`
   - Text: "Check out " + `<Link href="/who" className="underline hover:text-accent transition-colors">Who</Link>` + " to see how Continua works for individuals, couples, families, and teams."

4. Both pages are Server Components (no 'use client'). Both are static content with no dynamic data.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build`. Build should succeed. Both `/who` and `/what` routes should appear in build output with static indicators. Run `npm run lint` to check for TypeScript/ESLint errors.</verify>
  <done>Who page at /who renders h1 + four audience sections (Individuals, Couples, Families, Teams) with verbatim text + cross-link to /what. What page at /what renders h1 + three feature sections (Take Assessments, See Your Results with 3 paragraphs, Tools and Actions) with verbatim text + cross-link to /who. Both export unique metadata. Both use semantic HTML (main, h1, h2, section, p). All text matches architecture doc exactly.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run build` succeeds with all three routes (`/`, `/who`, `/what`) showing static generation indicators
2. `npm run lint` passes with no errors
3. Content in each page file matches docs/web-architecture.md verbatim (heading text, body paragraphs, cross-link text)
4. Each page exports unique `metadata` object with `title` and `description`
5. Typography uses exact pixel values: 48px/64px home heading, 32px page headings, 24px section headings, 18px/20px body text
6. Semantic HTML used: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Three page routes exist and build successfully as static pages
- Each page has unique metadata (title + description)
- All content is verbatim from architecture document
- Typography matches style guide specifications exactly
- Who page cross-links to What, What page cross-links to Who
- Semantic HTML structure on all pages (no generic divs for major structure)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-content-pages-and-seo/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
