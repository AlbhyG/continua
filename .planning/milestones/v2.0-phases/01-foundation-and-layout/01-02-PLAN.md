<objective>
Build the fixed header component with logo, navigation pills, and Sign In button, then set up the home page with proper content area constraints.

Purpose: Give visitors the branded Continua header that persists across all pages and establish the centered content layout pattern used by every page.
Output: Header component rendered on all pages via root layout, home page at "/" with correct max-width constraints.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Header component with logo and navigation pills</name>
  <files>src/components/layout/Header.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create directory `src/components/layout/` if it does not exist.

Create `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` as a Client Component with the following implementation:

```typescript
'use client'

import Image from 'next/image'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header className="fixed top-0 inset-x-0 z-50 bg-accent backdrop-blur">
      <div className="max-w-[720px] mx-auto px-4 py-3 flex items-center justify-between">
        <Link href="/">
          <Image
            src="/logo.png"
            alt="Continua"
            width={72}
            height={48}
            priority
          />
        </Link>

        <nav className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <button
            type="button"
            className="rounded-full bg-white/20 backdrop-blur px-4 py-1.5 text-sm font-bold text-white hover:bg-white/35 transition-colors"
          >
            Who
          </button>
          <button
            type="button"
            className="rounded-full bg-white/20 backdrop-blur px-4 py-1.5 text-sm font-bold text-white hover:bg-white/35 transition-colors"
          >
            What
          </button>
          <button
            type="button"
            className="rounded-full bg-white/20 backdrop-blur px-4 py-1.5 text-sm font-bold text-white hover:bg-white/35 transition-colors"
          >
            Book
          </button>
          <button
            type="button"
            className="rounded-full bg-white/20 backdrop-blur px-4 py-1.5 text-sm font-bold text-white hover:bg-white/35 transition-colors"
          >
            Sign In
          </button>
        </nav>
      </div>
    </header>
  )
}
```

Key implementation details:
- `'use client'` directive is required because the header will need dropdown state in Phase 2. Marking it now prevents future boundary changes.
- `fixed top-0 inset-x-0 z-50` positions header fixed at viewport top, full width, above all content.
- `bg-accent backdrop-blur` gives the header the blue accent background with blur effect per style guide.
- Content constrained to `max-w-[720px] mx-auto` per style guide.
- `px-4 py-3` for header padding per style guide.
- Logo uses `next/image` for automatic optimization. `priority` flag preloads it for LCP. `width={72} height={48}` matches style guide spec.
- Logo wrapped in `<Link href="/">` to navigate home (HEAD-02).
- Navigation uses `<nav>` for semantic HTML.
- Four pill buttons: Who, What, Book (HEAD-03), and Sign In (HEAD-04).
- Pill styling: `rounded-full bg-white/20 px-4 py-1.5 text-sm font-bold text-white` matches style guide exactly. `backdrop-blur` on pills per style guide.
- Hover state: `hover:bg-white/35` transitions to rgba(255,255,255,0.35) per style guide.
- `gap-2` between pills per style guide.
- NO responsive hiding — pills are visible at all screen sizes (HEAD-05). No hamburger menu. No `hidden md:flex` or similar responsive classes.
- Sign In button is a placeholder (non-functional) per project decision.
- Using `<button type="button">` for pills because they will be interactive dropdown triggers in Phase 2. Using buttons (not divs or spans) is correct for accessibility — they are focusable and activatable by keyboard.
  </action>
  <verify>
File `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` exists with:
- `'use client'` directive at top
- `next/image` used for logo with `width={72} height={48}`
- Logo wrapped in `Link` to "/"
- Four pill buttons: Who, What, Book, Sign In
- No responsive breakpoint classes that hide pills on mobile
- `fixed top-0` positioning
- `bg-accent backdrop-blur` background
  </verify>
  <done>Header component exists with fixed positioning, logo linking home at 72x48px, four navigation pills (Who, What, Book, Sign In) visible at all screen sizes, accent background with backdrop blur, content constrained to 720px.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Wire Header into layout and set up home page with content constraints</name>
  <files>src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update `src/app/layout.tsx` to import and render the Header component:

Add this import near the top (after existing imports):
```typescript
import Header from "@/components/layout/Header";
```

Update the body to include the Header:
```tsx
<body>
  <Header />
  {children}
</body>
```

The layout remains a Server Component. The Header is a Client Component imported into the Server Component tree — this is the correct Next.js pattern. The client boundary stays at the Header level; the layout and pages remain server-rendered.

Update `src/app/page.tsx` to the home page with proper content constraints:

```typescript
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-[375px] md:max-w-[720px] mx-auto px-6 pt-20">
      <h1 className="text-foreground">Continua</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Key implementation details:
- `max-w-[375px]` on mobile, `md:max-w-[720px]` at 768px+ breakpoint per style guide (FOUN-04).
- `mx-auto` centers the content column.
- `px-6` (24px) horizontal padding per style guide.
- `pt-20` (80px) top padding to clear the fixed header.
- Home page content is intentionally minimal in Phase 1 — just a heading to prove the route works (HOME-01). Full content (HOME-02, HOME-03) comes in Phase 3.
- Keep as Server Component (no 'use client') — this is static content.

After changes, run `npm run build` to verify:
1. Build succeeds without errors.
2. Home page is statically generated.
3. No TypeScript errors.

Then run `npm run dev` and verify in browser:
1. Header is fixed at top of viewport.
2. Logo appears on left at correct size.
3. Four pills appear on right side.
4. Content area is below header (not hidden behind it).
5. On narrow viewport (375px), pills don't collapse to hamburger.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` — build succeeds.
Run `npm run dev` and check in browser:
- Header is fixed at top, visible on scroll.
- Logo renders on left, clicking it stays on or navigates to "/".
- Four pills (Who, What, Book, Sign In) visible on right side of header.
- Resize browser to 375px width — pills remain visible, no hamburger menu.
- Content area sits below header with proper top padding (not occluded).
- Content area is centered with correct max-width at both mobile and desktop widths.
  </verify>
  <done>Header component renders on all pages via root layout. Home page displays at "/" with centered content area (375px mobile, 720px desktop). Header stays fixed at top with logo and four navigation pills visible at all screen sizes. Build succeeds.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. `npm run build` succeeds with no errors.
2. Home page at "/" shows fixed header at top of viewport.
3. Header has Continua logo (72x48px) on left, linking to "/".
4. Four pills (Who, What, Book, Sign In) on right side of header, white text on translucent background.
5. Header has accent blue background with backdrop blur effect.
6. Header does NOT collapse into hamburger menu at any viewport width — pills always visible.
7. Content area is centered with max-width 375px on mobile, 720px on desktop (768px+).
8. Content has 24px (px-6) horizontal padding and 80px top padding (clears header).
9. Scrolling keeps header fixed at top.
