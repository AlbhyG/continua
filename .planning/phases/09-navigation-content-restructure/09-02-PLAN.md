<objective>
Create the My Relationships and My Info content pages with proper SEO metadata, and optimize responsive layout for tablet and desktop screen sizes.

Purpose: Deliver the new content pages that the Learn dropdown navigates to, with content reframed from the old Who/What pages around the user's perspective (relationships and self-assessment). Ensure the layout works well across all target screen sizes.

Output: Two new content pages at /my-relationships and /my-info, responsive layout refinements.

  <name>Task 1: Create My Relationships and My Info content pages</name>
  <files>src/app/my-relationships/page.tsx, src/app/my-info/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create two new content pages following the exact pattern of the existing /who and /what pages (same layout structure, same Tailwind classes, same responsive breakpoints).

**My Relationships page** (`src/app/my-relationships/page.tsx`):

This page is the evolution of /who. It reframes the "Who is Continua For?" content around the user's relationships. Use the same content from `src/app/who/page.tsx` but with updated framing:

```typescript
import type { Metadata } from 'next'
import Link from 'next/link'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Relationships | Continua',
  description: 'Understand personality patterns in your relationships. See how Continua helps couples, families, and teams transform differences into complementarity.'
}

export default function MyRelationshipsPage() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-[375px] md:max-w-[720px] mx-auto px-6 pt-20 pb-12">
      <h1 className="text-[32px] font-bold mb-8">My Relationships</h1>
      <section className="space-y-8">
        {/* Reframe each section from the old /who page around the relationships perspective */}
        {/* Keep the exact same paragraph text from /who for each section */}
        {/* Sections: For Individuals, For Couples, For Families, For Teams */}
        {/* Use the same heading sizes and body text classes */}
      </section>
      <p className="text-[18px] md:text-[20px] leading-[1.6] mt-8 italic">
        Want to learn more about yourself? Check out <Link href="/my-info" className="underline hover:text-accent transition-colors">My Info</Link> to explore personality assessments and your personal profile.
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Copy ALL four content sections (For Individuals, For Couples, For Families, For Teams) verbatim from the existing `/who` page -- same headings, same paragraph text, same HTML structure. The only changes are:
- Page heading: "My Relationships" instead of "Who is Continua For?"
- Cross-link at bottom: points to /my-info instead of /what, with updated text
- Metadata: updated title and description

**My Info page** (`src/app/my-info/page.tsx`):

This page is the evolution of /what. It reframes the "What Does Continua Do?" content around the user's personal info/assessment. Use the same content from `src/app/what/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import type { Metadata } from 'next'
import Link from 'next/link'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Info | Continua',
  description: 'Understand your personality patterns across different contexts. Take assessments, see results, and get personalized insights with Continua.'
}

export default function MyInfoPage() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-[375px] md:max-w-[720px] mx-auto px-6 pt-20 pb-12">
      <h1 className="text-[32px] font-bold mb-8">My Info</h1>
      <section className="space-y-8">
        {/* Copy all three sections from /what verbatim */}
        {/* Sections: Take Assessments, See Your Results, Tools and Actions */}
        {/* Use the same heading sizes and body text classes */}
      </section>
      <p className="text-[18px] md:text-[20px] leading-[1.6] mt-8 italic">
        Check out <Link href="/my-relationships" className="underline hover:text-accent transition-colors">My Relationships</Link> to see how Continua works for couples, families, and teams.
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Copy ALL three content sections (Take Assessments, See Your Results, Tools and Actions) verbatim from the existing `/what` page -- same headings, same paragraph text (including the multi-paragraph See Your Results section), same HTML structure. The only changes are:
- Page heading: "My Info" instead of "What Does Continua Do?"
- Cross-link at bottom: points to /my-relationships instead of /who, with updated text
- Metadata: updated title and description

IMPORTANT: The body text content in both pages must be copied EXACTLY from the existing who/what pages. Do not rewrite or summarize. The content is authored text that should be preserved verbatim.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` -- both new routes should appear in build output as static pages. Verify `/my-relationships` and `/my-info` routes are listed. Verify each file exports `metadata` with unique title containing "| Continua". Verify each file contains a cross-link to the other page.
  </verify>
  <done>My Relationships page at /my-relationships shows all four audience sections with relationship-focused framing. My Info page at /my-info shows all three offering sections with self-assessment framing. Both have unique SEO metadata and cross-links to each other.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Optimize responsive layout for tablet and desktop</name>
  <files>src/app/my-relationships/page.tsx, src/app/my-info/page.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, src/app/layout.tsx</files>
  <action>
Ensure all pages render well at tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px+) widths.

The existing responsive approach uses `max-w-[375px] md:max-w-[720px]` which already handles mobile-to-tablet. Per the style guide, only the `md` breakpoint (768px) is used -- do NOT add `lg` or `xl` breakpoints for container width. The 720px max-width is intentional for content readability.

Verify and ensure the following responsive patterns are consistent across ALL content pages (home, my-relationships, my-info):

1. **Container**: `max-w-[375px] md:max-w-[720px] mx-auto px-6 pt-20 pb-12` (already present on all pages -- verify consistency)

2. **Page heading h1**:
   - Home page: `text-[48px] md:text-[64px] leading-[1.2] font-bold` (already present)
   - Content pages: `text-[32px] font-bold mb-8` (already present -- this is fine for subpages)

3. **Body text**: `text-[18px] md:text-[20px] leading-[1.6]` (already present -- verify all paragraph elements use this)

4. **Section headings h2**: `text-[24px] font-bold mb-3` (already present -- verify consistency)

5. **Header container** in layout.tsx: Already uses `max-w-[720px] mx-auto` -- verify this is correct.

6. **Footer** in layout.tsx: Already uses `max-w-[375px] md:max-w-[720px] mx-auto` -- verify this matches content area.

The responsive work for this phase is primarily about CONSISTENCY verification. The existing patterns already handle tablet well. For desktop (1024px+), the 720px centered content with the gradient background looks intentionally clean -- wider content is not needed per the style guide.

If any inconsistencies are found during verification, fix them. The new pages (my-relationships, my-info) should match the exact responsive classes used by the existing pages.

Run `npm run build` to confirm no errors after any adjustments.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` -- all pages build as static. Open the dev server (`npm run dev`) and verify at 375px, 768px, and 1024px widths that content is readable, properly sized, and centered. Specifically check: (1) no horizontal scroll at any width, (2) text scales between mobile and tablet, (3) content stays centered at desktop widths.
  </verify>
  <done>All pages (home, my-relationships, my-info) use consistent responsive classes. Content renders correctly at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+) widths. No horizontal scroll at any breakpoint.</done>

3. My Info page contains all three offering sections with verbatim content
4. Both pages export unique Metadata with title pattern "X | Continua"
5. Both pages have cross-links to each other using correct new URLs
6. Responsive classes are consistent across home, my-relationships, and my-info pages
7. No `href="/who"` or `href="/what"` references remain in codebase
