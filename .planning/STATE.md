## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Informational site only (no product features) — Ship marketing shell first, build product separately
- Visual-only Book dialogs — Avoid backend dependency; wire up real submissions later
- Placeholder Sign In button — Button present for layout completeness but non-functional
- No hamburger menu on mobile — Style guide specifies horizontal pills at all screen sizes
