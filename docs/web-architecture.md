All click through to the same page with a description of how this works for Individuals, Couples, Families, and Teams.

- The Header Stack stays the same except "Who" is greyed out.

#### "Who" Page Text

> **Who is Continua For?**
>
> **For Individuals**
>
> Continua helps you see your patterns across different situations and contexts. Maybe you're more conscientious at work than at home, more empathetic with friends than with co-workers. Understanding these shifts gives you real insight into how you operate in the world. You'll identify growth opportunities that matter to you, make better decisions about which environments bring out your best self, and build genuine self-awareness that goes beyond simple personality labels.
>
> **For Couples**
>
> Relationship friction often comes from misunderstood personality differences. When you can see exactly where your personalities align and diverge, those differences stop feeling like incompatibility and start looking like complementarity. Continua shows you how your partner's "opposite" traits might actually balance and strengthen your relationship. You'll understand why you react differently to the same situations, communicate more effectively, and access practical tools designed specifically for your unique combination.
>
> **For Families**
>
> Every family member brings a different personality profile to the table, and that complexity can create both richness and friction. Continua helps you map the whole ecosystem — see why siblings clash, understand parent-child dynamics, and recognize how everyone's wiring affects the family system. As children grow and circumstances change, you can track how these dynamics shift and adapt accordingly. The goal is helping everyone feel understood rather than judged.
>
> **For Teams**
>
> The best teams aren't made up of similar people — they're balanced across personality dimensions. Continua helps you assess whether your team has the range needed for a specific project, assign roles that match people's natural strengths, and identify gaps before they become problems. Whether you're building a new team or optimizing an existing one, you'll get insights into why certain combinations work and where personality differences might create friction worth planning around.

### 2.3 "What" Dropdown

Contains:

- Take a Test
- See Results
- Tools and Actions

All click through to the same page with a description of what you can do with Continua.

- The Header Stack stays the same except "What" is greyed out.

#### "What" Page Text

> **What Does Continua Do?**
>
> **Take Assessments**
>
> Your personality isn't static — it shifts based on context, relationships, and circumstances. That's why Continua offers hundreds of different assessment variations you can take whenever you want. Maybe you take one at work on a stressful Monday, another at home on a relaxed Sunday evening, and a third while traveling. Each snapshot captures where you are in that moment, and over time, these assessments build a rich picture of your personality patterns. You can tag each one with what you were doing, where you were, and who you were with, so you can start to see the contexts that bring out different aspects of yourself.
>
> **See Your Results**
>
> This is where it gets interesting. All your assessments are collected in one place, and you can view them in whatever way makes sense for what you're exploring. Want to see how your personality shifts over time? Sort by date. Curious whether you're different at home versus at the office? Filter by location. Wondering if certain activities bring out specific traits? Group by what you were doing.
>
> You can also organize results by cohort — look at yourself individually, compare your profile with your partner's, see how your family members' personalities interact, or understand your team's collective strengths and gaps. The visual displays show not just your individual profile, but how groups add up. Does your team cover all the personality bases needed for your project? Are you and your partner complementary across the key dimensions?
>
> Within each dimension, you can input specific goals and get personalized suggestions for how to optimize your approach. The system helps you understand not just where you are, but how to leverage that knowledge for the growth and outcomes you're after.
>
> **Tools and Actions**
>
> Understanding your personality is just the starting point — the real value comes from knowing what to do with that information. Within each dimension, you can set specific goals and get personalized recommendations tailored to your unique profile. Whether you're working on individual growth, strengthening a relationship, improving family dynamics, or optimizing team performance, Continua provides actionable strategies based on where you actually are, not where some generic type says you should be. The tools adapt to your specific patterns and contexts, giving you practical next steps that make sense for your situation.

## 3. Home Page Text

> How can we improve the human condition one person, one couple, one family, and one office at a time?
>
> This is not a goal with an end state but, rather, the beginning of a process. All personality characteristics function on continua. Most people fall somewhere between the extremes, and even those positions shift depending on context, stress, growth, and intention.
>
> The purpose of this exploration is not to define personality in a way that makes more effective business teams or helps people find their perfect mate. The purpose is to give people tools to better relate to their family, friends, and colleagues. To transform conflicts that feel like character incompatibility into recognition of complementary positioning. To replace judgment with curiosity. To move from "why can't you be different?" to "how can we leverage our differences?"
>
> We introduce that vision: a way of seeing personality as fluid coordinates across six primary axes — Empathy, Self-Orientation, Social Attunement, Conscientiousness, Agency, and Reactivity. Together, these six dimensions form a living system — a portrait of human nature in motion.
